## 4/13/19 : Prototype 1
Over the past few days we designed and lasercut our first prototype paraglider gondola.  We also started working on PID stabilization and tested the paraglider.  The big takeaway from this week is that the paraglider absolutely has to be powered to fly for more than 1-2 seconds.  Researching further, paragliders utilize a ram aerofoil which require constant power to inflate an provide lift.  We will now be adding the propeller as part of our baseline goals rather than as a reach goal.

## 4/8/19 : Beginning of Development
We began development on the BeagleBone Blue and learned how to read values from the gyro to control a servo.
